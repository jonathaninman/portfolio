## Projects
### Hospital Records Analysis - Virtual Client Project (_November 2024_)
- Transformed data from a .csv file describing the hospital visits of patients (treatments, admittance time, bill amount, etc.) into three different organized tables using **MySQL**
- Combined said three tables into one single SQL query that provided the data on the hospital visits and subsequent costs for patients over age 65 who qualify for Medicare
- Imported the final query into **PowerBI** in order to create compelling and easy to understand visuals showcasing the desired data
